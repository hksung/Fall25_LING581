    This file serves as the main entry point for the website's content. 
    It is typically used to define the homepage structure and content, 
    including links, introductory text, and any featured sections.

    If you need to update the list of previous courses, refer to the 
    `_data/previous_offering.yml` file. This file contains the data 
    for past courses and offerings, which can be dynamically included 
    in the homepage or other sections of the site. (currently commented)

    Ensure that any changes to this file align with the overall design 
    and structure of the website.
