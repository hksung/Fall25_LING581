# Final Project Proposal — Built from Your Background Research Brief

Each group should submit a developed version of the background Research Brief. This proposal extends and deepens what you wrote—same project, more concrete plans for the final project.
This is a graded assignment: **50 points total (10% of final grade).**

---
## Things to include

1. **Refined topic / Area & motivation**

   * 1–2 sentences on the focus; 3–5 keywords; why this matters.

2. **Research questions / Hypotheses**

   * Numbered RQs/Hs with brief operationalization (what counts as evidence).

3. **Expanded annotated bibliography**

   * Build on your 3–5 from the brief; for each source: citation • contribution • method/data • how it informs your design.

4. **Dataset details**

   * Source(s), size, splits, inclusion/exclusion, licensing/permissions.

5. **Methods & Tools**

   * Baseline approach and planned improvements (models, features, prompts, libraries).

6. **NLP experiment plan (required)**

   * Metrics (≥2, task-appropriate), **baseline vs. improved system**, ablation/robustness check, and error-analysis plan.

7. **Evaluation & Analysis**

   * What you will measure/compare; baselines; expected tables/figures (e.g., confusion matrix, per-label F1).

8. **Work plan (Timeline & Roles)**

   * Milestones with dates; team roles and owned tasks.

9. **Expected contribution & Risks**

   * What’s novel/useful; 1–2 key risks and mitigation strategies.

10. **Questions for feedback**

    * Two concrete questions you want answered at the next check-in.
