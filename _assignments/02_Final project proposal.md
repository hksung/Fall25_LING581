# Final Project Proposal

Each group should submit a developed version of the background research brief. This proposal extends and deepens what you wrote—same project, more concrete plans for the final project.
This is a graded assignment: **50 points total (10% of final grade).**

---

## Things to include

1. **Refined topic / Area & motivation**

   * 1–2 sentences on the focus; 3–5 keywords; why this matters.

2. **Research questions (RQs) / Hypotheses**

   * Numbered RQs/Hs with brief operationalization (what counts as evidence).

3. **Expanded annotated bibliography**

   * Build on your 3–5 from the brief; for each source: citation • contribution • method/data • how it informs your design.

4. **Dataset details**

   * Source(s), size, splits, inclusion/exclusion, licensing/permissions.

5. **Methods & Tools**

   * Baseline approach and planned improvements (models, features, prompts, libraries).

6. **NLP experiment plan (required)**

   * Metrics (≥2, task-appropriate), **baseline vs. improved system**, ablation/robustness check, and error-analysis plan.

7. **Evaluation & Analysis**

   * What you will measure/compare; baselines; expected tables/figures (e.g., confusion matrix, per-label F1).

8. **Work plan (Timeline & Roles)**

   * Milestones with dates; team roles and owned tasks.

9. **Expected contribution & Risks**

   * What’s novel/useful; 1–2 key risks and mitigation strategies.

10. **Questions for feedback**

    * Questions you want answered related to your project (optional).

| Criterion                                 | Points | Exemplary (full credit)                                                                                         | Proficient (-1–2 pts)                                      | Developing (-3–4 pts)                                | Missing/Insufficient (0) |
| ----------------------------------------- | -----: | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Refined topic / motivation**            |      4 | Focus is precise; 3–5 aligned keywords; clear, course-relevant motivation.                                      | Slightly broad or generic motivation.                      | Vague focus or mismatched keywords.                  | Not provided.            |
| **RQs / Hypotheses + operationalization** |      8 | 1–3 clear, testable RQs/Hs; measurable variables and success criteria stated.                                   | Clear RQs/Hs; partial operationalization.                  | Broad/descriptive RQs; little/no operationalization. | Not provided.            |
| **Expanded annotated bibliography**       |      8 | High-quality sources; each has contribution, method/data, and design relevance.                                 | Minor gaps in summaries or relevance.                      | Generic summaries; weak links to design.             | Not provided.            |
| **Dataset details**                       |      6 | Names/links, size, splits, inclusion/exclusion, licensing; choices justified.                                   | Most details present; minor omissions.                     | Key details missing (e.g., size/splits/licensing).   | Not provided.            |
| **Methods & Tools**                       |      6 | Baseline and improved approach clearly specified and justified; feasible with resources.                        | Present but light on justification or feasibility.         | Only baseline or only improved; unclear rationale.   | Not provided.            |
| **NLP experiment plan (required)**        |     10 | ≥2 appropriate metrics; baseline vs. improved; ablation/robustness; error-analysis plan; reproducibility steps. | Includes most elements; one is thin (e.g., ablation plan). | Major element missing (e.g., metrics or baseline).   | Not provided.            |
| **Evaluation & Analysis plan**            |      4 | What will be compared; expected tables/figures; criteria for interpreting results.                              | Comparisons defined but outputs/interpretation vague.      | High-level only; unclear outputs.                    | Not provided.            |
| **Work plan (timeline & roles)**          |      2 | Milestones with dates; clear ownership.                                                                         | Dates or ownership partially specified.                    | Vague milestones or roles.                           | Not provided.            |
